All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/userfrosting/sprinkle-core/compare/5.1.0...5.2.0)
- Vite is now the default bundler.

## [5.2.0](https://github.com/userfrosting/sprinkle-core/compare/5.1.0...5.2.0)
- [New Feature] Add [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) support :
  - New Vite Bakery command, `assets:vite`. This command can be used to 
  - Add [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) Twig function : `vite_js`, `vite_css` and `vite_preload` to include Vite entrypoints into any Twig template. 
  - The default bundler (Webpack or Vite) used by `assets:build` command can be defined using the `assets.bundler` config, or `ASSETS_BUNDLER` env variable. Webpack is used by default.
  - Added `assets.vite` config array in `app/config/default.php` to configure Twig integration. 
    - `assets.vite.dev` (bool) : Indicates whether the application is running in development mode (i.e. using vite server). Defaults to false. Tied to `VITE_DEV_ENABLED` env variable by default too.
    - `assets.vite.base` (string) : Public base path from which Vite's published assets are served. The assets paths will be relative to the `outDir` in your vite configuration.
    - `assets.vite.server` (string) : The vite server url, including port.
- [Bakery] The default sub commands in `AssetsBuildCommand` are now in `AssetsBuildCommandListener`
- [Bakery] Added the server option to `assets:webpack` to run HMR server (`npm run webpack:server`) plus use new npm command syntax.
- [Bakery] `AbstractAggregateCommandEvent` construction is now optional. Added `addCommands` and `prependCommands`. All setters methods return `$this`.
- [Sprunje] The sprunje toArray now returns the `sortable` and `filterable` keys. These will can be used by the frontend to dynamically display which columns is filterable/sortable.

## [5.1.2](https://github.com/userfrosting/sprinkle-core/compare/5.1.1...5.1.2)
- Replace `LocaleMiddleware` with `ServerRequestMiddleware`. A new class, `RequestContainer`, can be injected or retrieved from the container to get the server request. It will be `null` if the request is not defined (called before it is injected into the container by Middleware or if there's no request, e.g., a Bakery command).

### Bakery
- Rework assets building command. This change allows new bakery command to update Npm assets, and eventually allows sprinkles to replace webpack with something else (eg. Vite). The new commands are :
  - `assets:install` : Alias for `npm install`.
  - `assets:update` : Alias for `npm update`.
  - `assets:webpack` : Alias for `npm run dev`, `npm run build` and `npm run watch`, each used to run Webpack Encore.
  - `assets:build` : Aggregator command for building assets. Includes by default `assets:install` and `assets:webpack`. Sub commands can be added to `assets:build` by listening to `AssetsBuildCommandEvent`.
  - The old `webpack` and `build-assets` command are still available, and now alias `assets:build`. `bake` also uses `assets:build` now. 
- New Bakery commands : `serve` & `debug:twig`

- Reenable CSRF protection for all routes.
- Update `DebugCommand` : Split command into multiple subcommand and use `DebugCommandEvent` and `DebugVerboseCommandEvent` so custom command can be added to the debug command, like the `bake` command.
- Add `build-assets` as alias to `webpack` command for legacy purpose.
